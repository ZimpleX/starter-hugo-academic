<!-- I am a PhD candidate in Computer Engineering at USC, supervised by Prof. Viktor Prasanna. My main research goal is to improve the scalability, accuracy and efficiency of large scale graph learning. Towards the goal, during my PhD, I design new models, training/inference algorithms and hardware systems for Graph Neural Networks; after graduation, I will join Facebook/Meta AI as a research scientist to further explore practical solutions in web-scale social recommendation. 

Beyond graph learning, I am also generally interested in solving memory and computation intensive problems by algorithm-architecture mapping approaches. In my initial years of PhD, I accelerated the computation of Convolutional Neural Networks and graph analytics via parallelization on heterogeneous platforms (GPU, CPU and FPGA). -->

I am a Research Scientist at Meta AI, where I work on efficient graph learning models for web-scale social recommendation. Prior to Meta, I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Engineering at University of Southern California, advised by Prof. [Viktor Prasanna](https://sites.usc.edu/prasanna/). My thesis focused on improving the scalability, accuracy and efficiency of large scale Graph Neural Networks. I designed new neural network models, learning algorithms as well as hardware systems for GNN training and inference. My work has led to publications in top venues in both AI (ICLR, NeurIPS, etc.) and systems (FPGA, VLDB, TRETS, etc.). I have received outstanding reviewer awards from ICLR and ICML. 

I am broadly interested in problems in ML and system design. Please reach out to me via my personal email if you'd like to discuss.
